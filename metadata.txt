about=The Unsupervised Classification Plugin for QGIS is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the classification of satellite images using unsupervised learning algorithms. This plugin provides an easy-to-use interface for loading satellite images and selecting from a variety of unsupervised classification methods, including K-means and ISODATA. Key Features: 1. User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive dialog for selecting classification parameters. 2. Multiple Algorithms: Support for K-means and ISODATA algorithms. 3. Seamless Integration: Directly integrates with QGIS, allowing for easy access and visualization of classification results. 4. Flexible: Handles different types of satellite images and provides robust classification results. This plugin is ideal for remote sensing professionals, GIS analysts, and researchers looking to perform efficient and accurate unsupervised classification of satellite imagery within the QGIS environment. To use this Tool follow the below steps: 1. Click on the tool or chose "Raster" menu --> "MAS Raster Processing" menu item --> "Unsupervised Classifier" option. 2. Select 'Stack Image' or Image as Input and select output file name. 3. Select clustering method. 4. Adjust all parameters according to your needs. 'Number of Bands:' give you total number of bands, If you decrease it then it will remove that no of bands from process the clustering. or you can directly select those bands by check mark on 'Do you want to select available bands?' 5. Decide do you wants to open the output or not. 6. Click on "Run Clustering" or "Run Classification" button. FOR Version >= 1.0.0 follow below steps: 1. Launch the tool via the MAS Raster Processing toolbar or the Raster menu—all loaded raster layers in QGIS will automatically appear in the input list table. 2. Add additional rasters by clicking "Browse..." to select multiple files at once, or use the "Remove from List" button to remove unwanted entries. 3. Click anywhere on the "Select" or "Raster Name" columns to select/deselect rasters for batch processing, or use "Select All/Unselect All" for quick selection. 4. Click on the "Output File Name" column to edit output names for each raster as needed. 5. Select bands for processing: click "..." in the "Selected Bands" column or highlight a row and click "Select Bands" button to open the band selection window where you can check/uncheck individual bands. 6. Optionally set the output folder or check "Save output same as input folder?" to save outputs next to their source files. 7. Select your preferred clustering method (K-means or ISODATA) and adjust parameters such as number of clusters. 8. Check "Open the output in QGIS" if you want results loaded automatically after processing. 9. Click "Run Classification" to process all selected rasters in batch—a progress bar will display processing status and completion messages will show when finished. **Note: After installation make sure the following points; 1. Check Mark the Installed plugins (under 'Manage and Install Plugins...' menu) 2. Check Mark 'MAS Raster Processing' toolbar (by right click on toolbar).
